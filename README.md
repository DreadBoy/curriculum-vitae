# Curriculum Vitae
I've finished International Baccalaureate in 2010 and Master's degree in computer science in 2017. My current skill set includes React, AngularDart, AngularX, AngularJS and Aurelia, while I'm also familiar with jQuery, Bootstrap and Materialize. I've also worked with Express, Koa, .Net MVC and .Net Core. I'm fluent in Javascript, Typescript, Dart and C# but I've programmed in Python and Java too. In the past I've deployed my systems to AWS and Heroku but I'm most familiar with Google's AppEngine and associated services (Datastore, Memcache, Cloud Storage, Stackdriver, Big Query...).  I've dabbled in data science, AI and big data in the past but my main focus is web and game development. I can speak fluent Slovene and English but can also chat in German. 

This is collection of professional and free time projects I've worked on.

## Game jams
I often take part in offline game jams, where you have to start and finish functioning game on 48 hours. Teams are created on spot and in most cases consist of complete strangers that have to work together. At all of these jams I participate as programmer.
