## Interests
What shaped me most in my life is climbing, which I practiced for over 20 years, since I was 5. Sports gave me great working skills, discipline, perseverance and open-mindedness. I keep broadening my open-mindedness by travelling to other countries and continents, usually for a couple of weeks at a time. My travels have found me enjoying indigenous wedding in Central Sulawesi, herding pigs in Colombia, driving across Australia's outback and sleeping in Moroccan tent in the desert, among other things. I consider myself as ambitious and pragmatic person, always eager to learn and striving for more.

Below is a collection of professional and free time projects I've worked on.
